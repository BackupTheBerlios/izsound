/*
 * This implementation is based on the madldd program from Bertrand Petit.
 * I found it at http://www.bsd-dk.dk/~elrond/audio/madlld/ .
 * Indeed, the Mad library is _not_ documented (or if their authors think so,
 * they are _really_ ... mad). Its madldd program is actually an example of
 * how to use the libmad low-level functions. It is heavily documented and
 * helps understanding how it is possible to use this library.
 *
 * I have no doubt that the Mad library produces a high-quality decoding.
 * However, I have no doubt that its API is awful, and not having a single
 * clean documentation file (appart of the minimad.c file) is absolutely not
 * developer-friendly.
 *
 * At first, I tried to use the high-level function, as described in the
 * minimad.c example file. Indeed, the high-level API is quite easy to
 * understand. However, it has the following flaw: the decoding function holds
 * the looping logic. As a consequence, your program can't have the control of
 * the decoding process unless you do some silly hacks. You have the option to
 * call this function and tell it to run asynchronously. This way, the function
 * returns and you can do some other things. What happens is that the decoding
 * loops runs in a forked process. So with the needs I have (grab the data by
 * small chunks), the only issue was to do some silly hacks like using Unix
 * sockets just to get the data. Indeed, it would be produced in another
 * process ... That's why I had not choice but use the low-level functions.
 *
 * My implementation is a greatly refactor of madldd.c. Several things have been
 * changed and adapted to meet my needs. It now has a vague ressemblance with
 * the original work, but its author _really_ deserves some credit.
