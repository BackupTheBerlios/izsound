# A small Python-powered script to strip down the IzSound files tree. It wipes
# away the files generated by the autotools framework. These files can be
# generated again later by using the 'bootstrap.sh' script. The CVS (or any
# equivalent) repository should only contain the files left after running a
# 'make distclean' and this script.
