2003.12.29 (Julien Ponge):
* OggFileDecoder: the decoder goes in 'STOP' mode when the end of the file is
  reached.
* IzSound manual: an appendix for the third-party codes has been added.
* New MadDecoder DSP unit. It is working but some methods of the 'Player'
  interface are not yet implemented.

2003.12.28 (Julien Ponge):
* oggfiledecoder.h: comments fixes.

2003.12.27 (Julien Ponge):

* Added a new 'reset()' method to the DspUnit class.
* DataPicker and Flanger redefine their own 'reset()' method.

2003.12.19 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.12.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Fixed a bug when connecting/deconnecting DSP units on-the-fly.
* Added some missing HAVE_CONFIG_H preprocessor tests.

2003.12.16 (Julien Ponge):
* Better volume clipping (avoids 'clicks').

2003.12.15 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the BandFilter DSP unit.
* Minor Doxygen file tweak.

2003.12.09 (Julien Ponge):

[ IzSound 0.0.5 ] (2003.11.30) release-0-0-5

2003.11.30 (Julien Ponge):
* The Doxygen file has been updated (doxygen -u doxyfile).
* New IzSound release.

2003.11.29 (Julien Ponge):
* LibAOOutput: the driver can now be autodetected when passing 0 as the driver
  string.

2003.11.25 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: flushes its internal buffers when one of them becomes empty. Fixed
  a segfault-prone bug.

2003.11.24 (Julien Ponge):
* The configure script does not specify an arbitrary '-Ox' flag anymore.

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: some things had not been correctly merged during a CVS update. The
  problem is minor as only a comment had not been updated and a useless
  '#define' had not been removed.

[ IzSound 0.0.4 ] (2003.11.22) release-0-0-4

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* OggFileDecoder: fix so that we don't get minor gcc warnings at compilation time.
* New IzSound release.

2003.11.21 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger is now fully working.
* Added the 'const' qualifier for some DSP units methods.

[ IzSound 0.0.3 ] (2003.10.28) release-0-0-3

2003.10.28 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.10.20 (Julien Ponge):
* OssOutput and LibaoOutput should (hopefully !) be portable on big-endian
  architectures.

2003.10.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the '-pipe' GCC flag for the debug mode.

2003.10.17 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger implementation of 0.0.2 looks like a dead-end. The code of this
  unit has been removed and the flanger is broken for now. Don't use it as it
  does not even send the stream data to its successor unit. You've been warned.
* C++ Compiler (gcc) flags: added '-Wall' (important !) and '-fno-rtti' as well
  as '-fno-exceptions'.

2003.10.04 (Julien Ponge):
* New fragmenter unit.
* Small fixes.
* The DSP slots can now be binded (use with care !).
* New Flanger DSP. It is far from beeing functionnal though.

2003.09.28 (Julien Ponge):
* DeMultiplexer: better chaining checking fix.

  effect by delaying one of the two stereo channels.
* Added a new DSP DeMultiplexer that duplicates an input stream to several
  output streams.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Modified the bootstrapping process to call autoheader before automake.
* Added config.h.in (generated by autoheader) in the list of files to delete
  when calling the stripdown.py script.
