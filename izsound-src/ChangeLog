[ IzSound x.y.z ] (xxxx.yy.zz) release-x-y-z

2004.01.17 (Julien Ponge):
* Libtool versioning: moved from -release to -version-info. The versioning
  starts at 0:0:0 as of the 0.2.0 release.

2004.01.16 (Julien Ponge):
* Addition of Karl Pitrich's WhiteNoise DSP unit.

2004.01.11 (Julien Ponge):
* MadDecoder: a lot of enhancements thanks to Karl Pitrich. Now, the DSP unit
  does no longer need to make a scan of the file to decode to grab the length.
  The unit also recognizes Xing headers and the file is mmap'ed.
* Volume: Karl Pitrich contributed some code to enable some channel balancing
  operations.
* Documentation minor updates.
* MadDecoder is now licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL license because of
  the 3rd-party code used to implement it. The unit compilation can be disabled
  if you don't want it though.
* The IzSound license is now a 3 clauses BSD-style license instead of a 2
  clauses one. This is mainly to protect the author and its contributors names.

2004.01.07 (Julien Ponge):
* MadDecoder: error handling fix when opening a file.
* Flanger: a '#include <functional>' was missing in the header file and caused
  compilation errors with GCC 2.9x.

[ IzSound 0.1.0 ] (2004.01.05) release-0-1-0

2004.01.05 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release, leaving the alpha status for the beta status.

2004.01.03 (Julien Ponge):
* MadDecoder: all the methods are now implemented. However, seeking and getting
  the file duration implies that the file is entirely scanned when beeing
  opened. This is not optimal, but it works.
* Addition of a NEWS file in the source distribution.

2004.01.02 (Julien Ponge):
* New year copyright updates.

2003.12.30 (Julien Ponge):
* MadDecoder: stop() method fix so that it properly works.
* MadDecoder: getCurrentTime() is now implemented.

2003.12.29 (Julien Ponge):
* OggFileDecoder: the decoder goes in 'STOP' mode when the end of the file is
  reached.
* IzSound manual: an appendix for the third-party codes has been added.
* New MadDecoder DSP unit. It is working but some methods of the 'Player'
  interface are not yet implemented.

2003.12.28 (Julien Ponge):
* oggfiledecoder.h: comments fixes.

2003.12.27 (Julien Ponge):
* First appearance of the IzSound manual, written using XML DocBook.

2003.12.26 (Julien Ponge):
* Added a new 'reset()' method to the DspUnit class.
* DataPicker and Flanger redefine their own 'reset()' method.
* Doxygen documentation: SOURCE_BROWSER is not set to 'yes'.

[ IzSound 0.0.6 ] (2003.12.19) release-0-0-6

2003.12.19 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.12.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Fixed a bug when connecting/deconnecting DSP units on-the-fly.
* Added some missing HAVE_CONFIG_H preprocessor tests.

2003.12.16 (Julien Ponge):
* Better volume clipping (avoids 'clicks').

2003.12.15 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the BandFilter DSP unit.
* Minor Doxygen file tweak.

2003.12.09 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the DataPicker DSP unit.

[ IzSound 0.0.5 ] (2003.11.30) release-0-0-5

2003.11.30 (Julien Ponge):
* The Doxygen file has been updated (doxygen -u doxyfile).
* New IzSound release.

2003.11.29 (Julien Ponge):
* LibAOOutput: the driver can now be autodetected when passing 0 as the driver
  string.

2003.11.25 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: flushes its internal buffers when one of them becomes empty. Fixed
  a segfault-prone bug.

2003.11.24 (Julien Ponge):
* The configure script does not specify an arbitrary '-Ox' flag anymore.

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: some things had not been correctly merged during a CVS update. The
  problem is minor as only a comment had not been updated and a useless
  '#define' had not been removed.

[ IzSound 0.0.4 ] (2003.11.22) release-0-0-4

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* OggFileDecoder: fix so that we don't get minor gcc warnings at compilation time.
* New IzSound release.

2003.11.21 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger is now fully working.
* Added the 'const' qualifier for some DSP units methods.

[ IzSound 0.0.3 ] (2003.10.28) release-0-0-3

2003.10.28 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.10.20 (Julien Ponge):
* OssOutput and LibaoOutput should (hopefully !) be portable on big-endian
  architectures.

2003.10.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the '-pipe' GCC flag for the debug mode.

2003.10.17 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger implementation of 0.0.2 looks like a dead-end. The code of this
  unit has been removed and the flanger is broken for now. Don't use it as it
  does not even send the stream data to its successor unit. You've been warned.
* C++ Compiler (gcc) flags: added '-Wall' (important !) and '-fno-rtti' as well
  as '-fno-exceptions'.

2003.10.04 (Julien Ponge):
* New fragmenter unit.
* Small fixes.
* The DSP slots can now be binded (use with care !).
* New Flanger DSP. It is far from beeing functionnal though.

2003.09.28 (Julien Ponge):
* DeMultiplexer: better chaining checking fix.

[ IzSound 0.0.2 ] (2003.09.27) release-0-0-2

2003.09.27 (Julien Ponge):
* Added a new DSP DelayExtraStereo that applies a well-know stereo expansion
  effect by delaying one of the two stereo channels.
* Added a new DSP DeMultiplexer that duplicates an input stream to several
  output streams.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Modified the bootstrapping process to call autoheader before automake.
* Added config.h.in (generated by autoheader) in the list of files to delete
  when calling the stripdown.py script.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Initial IzSound release.
* The project homepage is at http://www.izforge.com/izsound/ .
