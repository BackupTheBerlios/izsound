[ IzSound x.y.z ] (xxxx.yy.zz) release-x-y-z

2003.11.25 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: flushes its internal buffers when one of them becomes empty. Fixed
  a segfault-prone bug.

2003.11.24 (Julien Ponge):
* The configure script does not specify an arbitrary '-Ox' flag anymore.

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Flanger: some things had not been correctly merged during a CVS update. The
  problem is minor as only a comment had not been updated and a useless
  '#define' had not been removed.

[ IzSound 0.0.4 ] (2003.11.22) release-0-0-4

2003.11.22 (Julien Ponge):
* OggFileDecoder: fix so that we don't get minor gcc warnings at compilation time.
* New IzSound release.

2003.11.21 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger is now fully working.
* Added the 'const' qualifier for some DSP units methods.

[ IzSound 0.0.3 ] (2003.10.28) release-0-0-3

2003.10.28 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.10.20 (Julien Ponge):
* OssOutput and LibaoOutput should (hopefully !) be portable on big-endian
  architectures.

2003.10.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the '-pipe' GCC flag for the debug mode.

2003.10.17 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger implementation of 0.0.2 looks like a dead-end. The code of this
  unit has been removed and the flanger is broken for now. Don't use it as it
  does not even send the stream data to its successor unit. You've been warned.
* C++ Compiler (gcc) flags: added '-Wall' (important !) and '-fno-rtti' as well
  as '-fno-exceptions'.

2003.10.04 (Julien Ponge):
* New fragmenter unit.
* Small fixes.
* The DSP slots can now be binded (use with care !).
* New Flanger DSP. It is far from beeing functionnal though.

2003.09.28 (Julien Ponge):
* DeMultiplexer: better chaining checking fix.

[ IzSound 0.0.2 ] (2003.09.27) release-0-0-2

2003.09.27 (Julien Ponge):
* Added a new DSP DelayExtraStereo that applies a well-know stereo expansion
  effect by delaying one of the two stereo channels.
* Added a new DSP DeMultiplexer that duplicates an input stream to several
  output streams.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Modified the bootstrapping process to call autoheader before automake.
* Added config.h.in (generated by autoheader) in the list of files to delete
  when calling the stripdown.py script.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Initial IzSound release.
