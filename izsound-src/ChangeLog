[ IzSound 0.0.3 ] (2003.10.28) release-0-0-3

2003.10.28 (Julien Ponge):
* New IzSound release.

2003.10.20 (Julien Ponge):
* OssOutput and LibaoOutput should (hopefully !) be portable on big-endian
  architectures.

2003.10.18 (Julien Ponge):
* Added the '-pipe' GCC flag for the debug mode.

2003.10.17 (Julien Ponge):
* The flanger implementation of 0.0.2 looks like a dead-end. The code of this
  unit has been removed and the flanger is broken for now. Don't use it as it
  does not even send the stream data to its successor unit. You've been warned.
* C++ Compiler (gcc) flags: added '-Wall' (important !) and '-fno-rtti' as well
  as '-fno-exceptions'.

2003.10.04 (Julien Ponge):
* New fragmenter unit.
* Small fixes.
* The DSP slots can now be binded (use with care !).
* New Flanger DSP. It is far from beeing functionnal though.

2003.09.28 (Julien Ponge):
* DeMultiplexer: better chaining checking fix.

[ IzSound 0.0.2 ] (2003.09.27) release-0-0-2

2003.09.27 (Julien Ponge):
* Added a new DSP DelayExtraStereo that applies a well-know stereo expansion
  effect by delaying one of the two stereo channels.
* Added a new DSP DeMultiplexer that duplicates an input stream to several
  output streams.

2003.09.22 (Julien Ponge):
* Modified the bootstrapping process to call autoheader before automake.
* Added config.h.in (generated by autoheader) in the list of files to delete
  when calling the stripdown.py script.
