[ Introduction ]

This extension wraps the IzSound library to make it available by Python
programs. The wrappers are generated using Swig. IzSound is a C++ sound
processing library which is very simple to understand.

More on IzSound can be found at http://www.izforge.com/izsound/ .
It is available under a 3 clauses BSD-style license (see COPYING).

[ Requirements ]

Python 2.3+
Swig 1.3.19+ (if you want to modify the default wrapping)
GCC 3.3+

The IzSound version that you need is the one that matches the IzSound-Python
one. For instance if you have downloaded IzSound-Python x.y.z, then you'll need
IzSound x.y.z.

[ Using it ]

The wrapped classes are available in the 'izsound' package. Just import it and
have fun. Only the users APIs have been wrapped. They exactly match their C++
counterparts. See the 'test.py' example.
