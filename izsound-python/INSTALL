By default, every IzSound DSP unit will be wrapped. However, every IzSound DSP
unit that has a requirement on the GPL license can be disabled at compilation
time. It is possible to disable the wrappers generation for these DSP units.

1/ The 'swig-it.py' script invokes Swig to generate the wrappers code. Try
'./swig-it.py --help' to see the options.

2/ IzSound-Python uses the Python distutils package. Take a look at the
'setup.cfg' file to customize it to your specific needs.

3/ Build the extension the standard way ('python setup.py build install' for
instance).
